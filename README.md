# RoverChallengePlat45-RUBY
Thank you for taking the time to review my code. 

This isn't as polished as my previous attempt. I struggled with various things - mainly switching my thinking from Python to Ruby. I used my pervious challenge as a base and reworked the code into Ruby. As a result, I hit a few snags along the way. I managed to work through it and although I wanted to clean up my code even more before submission, I decided that this is probably more of a true representation of where my abilities are at this point in time. 

I will continue to brush up before my start date.
